## Introduction

In this guide, we will focus on styling the popup interface for the "Text Changer" Chrome Extension using CSS. The popup is a crucial part of the user experience, providing a simple and intuitive interface for interacting with the extension.

## Creating the file

To follow along in this next section, create a new file in your project called `popup.css`. You can put this in the main folder but if you prefer to be more organized, you can put it in a scripts folder and modify the manieft if you know what you are doing. For now, the main folder works just fine.

## Styling the Popup with CSS

### Overview of `popup.css`

The `popup.css` file contains the style definitions for the popup's HTML elements. Here's a breakdown of the styles defined in the file:

### Style Breakdown

```css
body {
    width: 200px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    padding: 20px;
    gap: 15px;
    flex-direction: column;
}
```

- **Body Styling**: 
  - Sets the width to 200px.
  - Uses flexbox for layout with centered items.
  - Adds padding and spacing (gap) for a clean look.
  - Arranges items in a column.

```css
button {
    background-color: rgb(148, 248, 153);
    color: rgb(15, 32, 15);
    font-size: large;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 10px;
    transition: all 0.2s ease-in-out;
}
```

- **Button Styling**:
  - Defines a light green background with dark text for contrast.
  - Sets a large font size for readability.
  - Adds padding for a more clickable area.
  - Removes the border and adds rounded corners for a modern look.
  - Includes a transition effect for interactive feedback.

```css
input {
    padding: 10px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    border: 1px solid #BBB;
    font-size: large;
}
```

- **Input Styling**:
  - Adds padding for comfortable text entry.
  - Rounds the corners to match the button style.
  - Outlines the input with a subtle border.

```css
button:hover {
    color: rgb(148, 248, 153);
    background-color: rgb(15, 32, 15);
    cursor: pointer;
}
```

- **Button Hover Effect**:
  - Inverts the color scheme on hover for visual feedback.
  - Changes the cursor to a pointer to indicate interactivity.

### Key Considerations

- **Consistency**: The styling ensures a consistent and modern look throughout the popup.
- **User Experience**: The hover effects and comfortable padding improve the overall user experience.
- **Accessibility**: High contrast and large text make the popup more accessible.

In the next section, we'll explore how these styles interact with the popup's HTML structure (`popup.html`) and how they contribute to the functionality and aesthetics of the "Text Changer" extension. Stay tuned for a step-by-step guide on assembling the popup interface.
