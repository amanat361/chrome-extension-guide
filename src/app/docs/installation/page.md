## Introduction

Before we create our own chrome extension, it's essential to set up a proper development environment. This section will guide you through the installation of necessary tools and the initial setup required to start building your Chrome extension.

## Preparing Your Development Environment

### 1. Install a Code Editor

A code editor is where you'll write and manage your extension's code. Some popular options include:

- **Visual Studio Code**: A powerful, free code editor from Microsoft with extensive extension support.
- **Sublime Text**: A fast and efficient text editor known for its speed and ease of use.
- **Atom**: An open-source text editor developed by GitHub, known for its community-driven plugins.

### 2. Install Google Chrome

Since we're developing a Chrome extension, having the latest version of Google Chrome is a must. You can download it from [Google Chrome's official website](https://www.google.com/chrome/).

### 3. Familiarize Yourself with Chrome Developer Tools

Chrome Developer Tools will be essential for debugging your extension. You can access it in Chrome by right-clicking on any webpage and selecting 'Inspect' or by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+I` (`Cmd+Option+I` on Mac).

## Setting Up Your Extension's Development Folder

1. **Create a New Folder**: This will be your workspace where all your extension files will reside.
2. **Folder Structure**: Inside, create sub-folders for your HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. A typical structure may look like this:
   - `/your-extension-name`
     - `/Images`
     - `manifest.json`
     - `...`

## Understanding Chrome Extension Components

1. **Manifest File**: This JSON file (`manifest.json`) defines your extension's metadata, settings, and permissions.
2. **Content Scripts**: JavaScript files that interact with web page content.
3. **Popup HTML**: The HTML file for your extension's user interface.
4. **Background Scripts**: (Optional) Scripts that run in the background and manage global extension behavior.

## Adding Icons To Your Chrome Extension
One or more icons that represent the extension or theme. You should always provide a 128x128 icon; it's used during installation and by the Chrome Web Store. Extensions should also provide a 48x48 icon, which is used in the extensions management page (chrome://extensions). You can also specify a 16x16 icon to be used as the favicon for an extension's pages.

Icons should generally be in PNG format, because PNG has the best support for transparency. They can, however, be in any raster format supported by Blink, including BMP, GIF, ICO, and JPEG.

{% callout type="warning" title="Supported Files" %}
WebP and SVG files are not supported. PNG is preferred.
{% /callout %}

Here's an example of how to declare the icons in the manifest:

```json
 "icons": {
    "16": "icon16.png",
    "32": "icon32.png",
    "48": "icon48.png",
    "128": "icon128.png"
  },
```

{% callout title="Note" %}
You may provide icons of any other size you wish, and Chrome will attempt to use the best size where appropriate.
{% /callout %}
See [Extension icons](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/images#icons) details on Chrome Web Store requirements and best practices.

## Testing Your Extension

{% callout title="Before you test it!" %}
Your chrome extension wont do anything or even load just yet. Keep on following the guide and then try these steps again once your manifest file is properly setup. This guide mostly focuses on creating the extention itself. For more information on chrome's dev tools, go [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions).
{% /callout %}

1. **Load Your Extension into Chrome**:
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable 'Developer mode' at the top right.
   - Click 'Load unpacked' and select your extension's folder.
2. **Iterative Development**: Make changes to your code and reload the extension regularly to test and debug.

## Conclusion

With your development environment set up and a basic understanding of Chrome extension components, you're now ready to start building the Text Changer Chrome Extension. The next sections will guide you through each component, starting with the manifest file. Let's begin your journey into Chrome extension development!
